# Changes Made to Fix CloudFront Manager Issues

## Issue Summary

The CloudFront Manager application was experiencing issues with the "Create Distribution" button not working, resulting in 500 Internal Server Error responses. The root causes were:

1. AWS SDK v2 is not included by default in Node.js 18.x Lambda runtime
2. CORS headers were not properly configured
3. Lambda functions lacked proper permissions to invoke other Lambda functions

## Changes Made

### 1. CDK Infrastructure Changes

- Added a proxy Lambda function for handling CORS and invoking the main function
- Updated the API Gateway integration to use the proxy function
- Added IAM permissions to allow Lambda functions to invoke other Lambda functions
- Added proper bundling configuration to include dependencies in the Lambda deployment packages

### 2. Lambda Function Changes

- Updated Lambda functions to use AWS SDK v3 instead of v2
- Created a common CORS module for consistent header handling
- Updated CORS headers to allow requests from any origin
- Implemented proper error handling and logging

### 3. Deployment Scripts

- Created a deployment script to help with deploying Lambda functions with their dependencies
- Added documentation on how to deploy the updated code
